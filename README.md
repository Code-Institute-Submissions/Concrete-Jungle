## UX
----

-   ### <strong>User Stories</strong>
The website has been built for two main types of users:
1. Fans of the collective or first-time visitors that want to learn more about Concrete Jungle, discover new music, 
keep up to date with events and subscribe to join the growing community.
2. Event organisers who want to book Concrete Jungle for both public and private events, 
e.g club nights, bar events, PR events, weddings, parties or other private functions.

As mentioned in the intro, the website has been designed to contain features that allow both user types 
to easily achieve what they have come to the site for. 

The site has been designed considering UX design principles to allow users to easily navigate the website and 
find what they want. The color scheme, imagery, fonts have been chosen in order to ensure a positive user experience, while also adhering to the style, values
and branding direction of Concrete Jungle. The website has been built to be responsive to ensure a positive user experience 
across all device types.

The intial wireframes mock ups for each device type can be viewed here: [large screen](wireframes/wireframes-large.pdf), [mobile](wireframes/wireframes-mobile.pdf), [tablet](wireframes/wireframes-tablet.pdf)

The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project.

- [W3C Markup Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input)
    - The Markup Validator only threw up one warning regarding the date tab on the 'Bookings' Section
        - Warning message: "The date input type is not supported in all browsers. Please be sure to test, and consider using a polyfill."
        - However, this has not been an issue on all browsers tested. 
    - One error regarding the input attribute for the 'Book Now' and 'Sign Up' buttons was highlighted and ammended (type="input" changed to type="submit").

-  [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input)

    - No errors in the style.css file were detected after running the CSS code through the validator.

### <strong>Known Bugs</strong> 

-   On iPhone SE, the footer section is positioned incorrectly and overlaps with the forms on the 'Booking' and 'Subscribe' sections.
-   On several mobile devices, the footer jumps up behind the form when typing text into the text input areas, however it does not impede the completion of the form.
-   On Huawei Y6, the header/background images for the 'Events' and 'Bookings' sections do not load (on other Huawei devices, this bug did not occur)
-   On Firefox and Safari, the 'Robot Mono' space font used for the logo and headings is not appearing. Both browsers deploy the back-up 'Monospace' font.
