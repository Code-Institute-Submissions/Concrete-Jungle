----

-   ### User Stories
The website has built for two main types of users:
1. Fans of the collective that want to learn more about Concrete Jungle, discover new music, 
keep up to date with events and subscribe to join the growing community
2. Event organisers who want to book Concrete Jungle for both public and private events, 
e.g club nights, bar events, PR events, weddings, parties or other private functions.

As mentioned in the intro, the website has been designed to contain features that allow both user types 
to easily achieve what they have come to the site for. 

The site has been designed considering UX design principles to allow users to easily navigate the website and 
find what they want. The color scheme, imagery, fonts have been chosen in order to ensure a positive user experience, while also adhering to the style, values
and branding direction of Concrete Jungle. The website has been built to be responsive to ensure a positive user experience 
across all device types.
